# LLM
The file demonstrates the process of preparing text data for LLM training, starting with reading a short story called "The Verdict" into Python. It first implements a basic tokenizer that splits text into individual words and special characters, creating a vocabulary mapping tokens to unique IDs. Then it progresses to using a more sophisticated Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer through the tiktoken library, which is what GPT models use. The code shows how to create input-target pairs using a sliding window approach, where each input sequence predicts the next token. It implements a custom PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader to efficiently batch the data. Finally, it covers creating token embeddings by converting token IDs into fixed-dimensional vectors and adding positional embeddings to retain information about word order in the sequence. The example uses a 256-dimensional embedding space for demonstration, though production models like GPT-3 use much larger dimensions.
